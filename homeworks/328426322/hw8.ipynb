This could show that subjects who started at a higher height tend to grow at a faster rate. This means that at the start of the study, taller boys usually grow quicker in a shorter time. The positive correlation at ~0.5 means that the differences in height among boys are not closing over time but potentially widening. The variation isn't just in where boys start, but also in how fast they grow. A negative correlation would indicate that shorter boys grow faster.
